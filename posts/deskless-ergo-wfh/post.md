---

With the recent mass migration to working from home to help [mitigate
the spread of covid-19][][^urgency], there are likely many people out
there who are working from home for the first time, and do not yet
have a very ergonomic setup. It occurred to me that some of my
alternative computer setups might be helpful. If you are spending lots
of time on the computer, it's worthwhile to experiment and hone your
ergonomics. Your body will thank you!

The purpose of this post is to share a few strategies for easy and
inexpensive ergonomic[^ergo-hobbyist] home setups, some of which may
easily be seen as highly unusual. Since these ideas might help people
work in much healthier ways, I wanted to present them in the best
light possible, by carefully writing more structured, instructive, and
prettier posts.

But you know what? Screw it! These massive societal transitions are
happening **right now**, so this post was written in a
few days, and just does a surface-level description of a variety of
ideas.  Hopefully the details will be filled in / clarified in the
future. In the meantime, hopefully you find something useful despite
the gaps!

  If you're tired of everything being about covid-19, my apologies for
  bringing it up at the beginning. It is the direct cause of me
  rushing these ideas out in the form of this post, though.

## Suspending your laptop / monitor

Typically your screen is supported by a desk. I've found suspending my
screen to be a versatile, portable, and convenient way to position it.
It is ergonomically helpful to entirely decouple the positioning of
your screen from the positioning of your keyboard, so that both can be
in a comfortable position. Here is my most recent setup:

![photo of a recliner with a monitor suspended by rope
](./images/recent-reclining.jpg)

Most of this setup is described in my ["Outdoor Computing with a Deck
Desk" post][], the new bit is the suspended monitor!

The materials involved here are:

* Heavy duty screw eye bolts, in this case they were already there to
support a yoga swing. I left the yoga swing handles up, one of them
turns out to be helpful for getting in and out of the recliner.

* The monitor plate from a [VESA mount quick release bracket][], to
  provide an attachment point for the rope.

* [Progrip "Better Than Bungee" paracord tie-downs][] to provide
  adjustability. These are not actually in the picture above, I was
  using plain rope before, but I now prefer these as they are much
  more adjustable.

* Any sufficiently strong rope / cord will do, but I used [5mm black
accessory cord][]. This rope threads through the VESA mount plate, and
wrap around the corners of the monitor, like this:

![back of suspended monitor
](./images/back-of-suspended-monitor.jpg)

This has worked shockingly well! The ropes have not slipped off the
corners, even when carrying the monitor around suspended upright like
this. There is a potential risk that might happen at some point, so
I've ordered [a monitor mount][] which I believe will provide an
attachment point directly above the monitor's center of mass. I'll
update this post, possibly write a new post once I've attempted to use
that monitor mount.

There's a lot of versatility and adjustability here:

* By attaching an adjustable cord to the back of the monitor, to
  another hook offset back, the inclination of the monitor can be
  adjusted for reclining, as shown above. Now that it's more
  adjustable, I tend to prefer the monitor to be a foot or two closer
  than what's shown in the picture.

* The monitor can be suspended nearly perfectly vertically, as shown
  in [the standing section below](#deskless-standing-keyboard). This
  may have something to do with the weight distribution of the
  monitor, an [Acer B326HK][].

* By unwrapping the rope from the corners, the monitor can be brought
  entirely horizontal, for a supine setup. Be sure to support the
  monitor when doing this, otherwise it might drop and jerk the rope.

Doing this with full size, 26lb (~12kg) monitors is a recent thing for
me. Previously I'd only done this with laptops[^adhesive-hangers] -
for example in my post about [supine computing][]. Here's a photo from
that post:

![Using a computer ergonomically in a hammock, via external split keyboard and computer suspended above head
](/posts/supine-computing/images/back-yard-hammock.jpg)

I do this supine posture more frequently on a couch or bed, or the
floor, but hammocks are my favorite! Since [that post][supine
computing] already goes into some details of the supine posture, I
won't cover it much more in this post.

[^adhesive-hangers]:
    For suspending something as light as laptops, I've also found that
    ["Multi Purpose No Drilling Required Ceiling Hooks Suspension and
    Wall Hooks Hangers"][adhesive-hangers] from the cryptic brand
    "CRH600" work quite well. The nice thing about these are that they
    do not require any permanent modifications to the ceiling.

## Deskless standing keyboard

Ok, remember what I wrote earlier about unusual but effective ideas?
This is the one I've been most hesitant to share more broadly, because
it initially looks very strange, but works fantastically well. Please
mentally substitute in alternate versions of these pictures that make
the idea seem super cool and practical to you.

![photo of standing with a monitor suspended by rope, keyboard suspended from pants
](./images/recent-standing.jpg)

Materials:

* I most regularly do this with a [Kinesis Advantage 2][], but I've
  also had success with the [Keyboardio Model 01][] and the [Massdrop
  ErgoDox][]. These keyboards aren't cheap, but they are awesome! If
  you're on the computer for many hours a day, an investment in a good
  keyboard will amortize quickly. I can't imagine how to do this
  comfortably with standard ergo keyboards (please surprise me!).

* For the [Kinesis Advantage 2][], I use a [giant releasable zip
  tie][] - 28" (71cm) long with 175lb (80kg) of tensile strength!

* Pants with a drawstring[^fly-alternative]. The giant releasable zip
  tie gets looped through the drawstring, and then around the
  Kinesis[^drawstring-details]:

  [^fly-alternative]:
      It's a bit silly, but an alternative for jeans and other pants
      with a fly is to thread the giant zip tie through the top of the
      fly.

  [^drawstring-details]:
      The Kinesis particularly ends up at a nice angle if you get the
      drawstring on the front side (the side with the keys).

You might wonder why these pictures are outside. Well, they were
originally intended for my ["Tree Based Computing"][] post which
describes a highly portable way to use your computer
outside[^this-post-half-outside], without sacrificing ergonomics. See
that post for a few more pictures of this keyboarding posture.

[^this-post-half-outside]:
    A substantial chunk of this post was [written outside with my
    computer on a tree]["Tree Based Computing"] post :) Here's [a
    pic](./images/tree-based-writing.jpg)

This might seem too simple, perhaps not rotationally stable
enough. However, I've found that rotation isn't a problem in
practice - all that is needed is support that's roughly centered. I
arrived at this approach after a fair bit of experimentation. See, for
example, one of the very first iterations, in this photo from 2017:

![early tree based computing
](./images/early-tree-based-computing.jpg)

Back then, I'd just assumed the keyboard needed rotational stability,
and had two of the massive 28" zip ties crossing each other to create
offset attachment points. I then used normal size [releasable zip
ties][] to secure these to my jeans' belt loops.

People's proportions, such as [ape factor][] differ quite a bit, so it
may be that you need more adjustability than I do. Using the
releasable zip ties to secure the giant zip ties does have a nice
advantage of providing finer adjustment of the keyboard's vertical
position[^suspenders].

[^suspenders]:
    Another option for keyboard suspension is... suspenders! Well, not
    exactly, ordinary suspenders are likely too elastic. I've
    experimented with using rope around the shoulders, and it worked
    pretty decently - very adjustable! It wasn't for me, though, no
    significant advantages over pant attachment.

## Why a deskless standing keyboard?

You might be wondering, quite reasonably, why do something so odd
looking with your keyboard? There are some very good reasons! Here are
a few:

* **Relief from hand/wrist pain!** (potentially[^pain-relief-anecdotes])

  [^pain-relief-anecdotes]:
      I know of several people who report that this keyboard position
      has relieved their wrist pain. I might go into details of these
      anecdotes, with their permission, in future posts.

      Thankfully, I personally haven't had much wrist discomfort in
      recent years. Many years ago I started having early symptoms,
      which caused me to take evasive action. Specifically, I got into
      split keyboards and became more tuned in to how my hands/wrists
      feel in a given position.

* **No platform** needed for resting your keyboard, which can mean
  less furniture needed for your workstation. It's also quite
  portable, which is helpful for travelling or ["Tree Based
  Computing"][].

* **Movement!** The flexibility to move around quite a bit, stretch,
  and "dance" without interrupting typing or needing to adjust your
  arm positions. A typical standing desk can accommodate some movement
  while typing, but not all that much since the keyboard is
  stationary, so movement interferes more with typing. It's tough to
  explain this properly in text / picture form, perhaps one day there
  will be video explaining this more directly :)

* **More relaxed!** My arms can mostly relax with this posture. In
  comparison, the prevailing ergonomic recommendation for typing while
  sitting typically involves elbows at an angle, with hands hovering
  to avoid wrist pressure (which can impinge on nerves). This requires
  some continuous muscle tension which just doesn't seem sustainable
  for long sessions.

* **Touch typing!** Well, this is more of a prerequisite than a
  benefit. But if you don't already touch type, this might be an
  interesting way to force yourself to learn!

Stay tuned for more details, I have a post in progress going into more
depth. Particularly, it explores more why this postures is
ergonomically sound, and how to do it with split
keyboards[^split-keyboards].

[^split-keyboards]:
   The gist of it is to wear pants with a belt or belt loops.  Then
   use string or releasable zip ties to thread around the belt or
   loops, to attachment points on the corners of the keyboard halves.
   **For the Keyboardio Model 01** the best approach I've found is to
   use bike rack struts [like
   these](https://smile.amazon.com/Sunlite-Extended-Strut-Kit-290mm/dp/B002MKJSVI).
   The slot of the bike rack strut perfectly fits the shank of 1/4"
   screws that go into the keyboardio mounting hole. I haven't
   purchased those particular ones, but I imagine the slot size is
   pretty standard. This creates a rigid attachment point above the
   keyboard half's center of mass. **For the ErgoDox**, the best
   approach I had was to use loops of string through the corner holes
   for the screws. More details and images in a future post, hopefully
   soon! :)

## Too wild? How about laptop stand, a box, or shelf!

Ok, I imagine for many of you this seems too weird or too much
work. That's fine! I have some ideas for quick ergonomic hacks. It's
no coincidence that all of these pictures happen to be from travel.

* Laptop stands can be nice for elevating the screen.  I quite like
  the portability of my [Roost stand][], here being used in an
  airport with a [Keyboardio Model 01][]:

  ![Laptop on roost stand with keyboardio on either side
  ](./images/roost-keyboardio-airport.jpg)

* Generally whatever you can do to raise your screen closer to eye
  level helps. Here's a funny picture from my travels in 2014, back
  when I had a functioning ErgoDox:

  ![ThinkPad on supportive statue with ErgoDox
  ](./images/polkadot-ergodox.jpg)

* A hacky standing setup is just to put your computer on a shelf at
  head height, and keyboard on a lower shelf. I don't have good
  picture of using a shelf, but here's a photo from 2018 travels of my
  computer in the top of a wardrobe. The side screen is a [packed
  pixels][].

  ![laptop with packed pixels side screen, in wardrobe
  ](./images/wardrobe-computing.jpg)

* In past travels I've also placed my laptop on top of a sturdy
  cardboard box, with the open part of the box facing me, and within
  the box placed the keyboard (or half of it!).

## Treadmill computing!

Walking on a treadmill while using a computer is a wonderful way to
get some exercise. I find that after 10 or 20 minutes of walking, some
nice exercise endorphins begin to release, which feel good and
potentially aid in productivity.

Beyond that effect, I think there is something deeply satisfying about
moving forward. Our minds might know that we are making great progress
by sitting, thinking, and typing, but how are our bodies feeling about
this? I'm quite certain they prefer to move. I think of it in terms of
our evolutionary history - back in prehistory, prehumanity even, we'd
be doomed to starvation if not regularly hunting, foraging, and
exploring. Deep down, we feel like something is wrong if we aren't
regularly moving and spending time outside.

Here's a photo of one of my most photogenic treadmill desk
configurations, [outside on a deck](/posts/deck-desk/), from the
summer of 2018:

![treadmill desk on deck with trees in the background
](/posts/deck-desk/images/pretty-desk.jpg)

Unlike the other strategies here, this certainly isn't deskless, and
involves some expensive equipment[^pretty-desk-furniture]. I don't
have this stuff in my new home in Colorado, as it didn't fit in my
car.

Since I am now working from home, getting a new treadmill was quite
justified. This time, I purchased [a much less expensive
treadmill][Goplus treadmill], which arrived a couple days ago. By
affixing a cardboard produce box with couple releasable zip-ties, I
ended up with a platform for my keyboard with a very nice tilt. This
is likely to be totally different soon, but it's already quite
decent. Here are a couple pictures:

![diy treadmill desk under hammock stand, with monitor suspended
](./images/outdoor-treadmill.jpg)

I've been pleasantly surprised by this treadmill - today I walked 8.5
miles while working! I can't really give a full review, since I've
only had it for 2 days. It's quite as smooth or quiet as the IMovr,
but it's 1/5 the cost and works decently. I've put some more
preliminary notes about it in a footnote[^treadmill-comparison].

[^treadmill-comparison]:
  A few notes about how my initial impression of the "Goplus" /
  "Costway" / "Gymax" branded treadmill compares to my recollection of
  using the [IMovr Thermotread GT][]:
  * 1/5 the cost!
  * Not as big of a walking platform. I only really notice the lower
    width, which means I've gotta be fairly precise about my
    side-to-side position. Not finding it to be troublesome, though.
  * Beeps loudly with every button press of the remote, which is
    annoying, definitely wouldn't be office friendly. I might open it
    up to disable whatever the beep is coming from.
  * Units are in kilometers instead of miles, which is fine, but not
    intuitive for me.
  * Nice to be able to go faster than 2.5mph (the IMovR's upper
    limit). I've found I can still type decently at about 3mph.
  * Much easier to move around than the IMovr, since it's about half the weight

One tip to wrap this section up - for me, listening to energetic music
makes treadmill computing **so** much more sustainable for longer
durations. This is also true of the standing postures, particularly as
the music often inspires me to dance! Variation in position, dynamic
movements, are far more sustainable for longer durations than
attempting to stand or sit still.

## Variety is key

I read the book ["The Healthy Programmer"][], by Joe Kutner early in
my journey of finding healthier ways to work. It's a helpful book, I
particularly recommend it if you are feeling sedentary / inflexible /
averse to exercise. My main takeaway was that periodically switching
between a **variety** of decent postures is preferable to trying to
find a single "optimal" one. This was particularly in the context of
switching between sitting and standing, but it can also be applied to
switching between the following two groups of postures:

* **Reclining / supine:** These two postures are quite similar, just a
  difference of some inclination. They are very relaxing and ergonomic
  positions, as very little muscle tension is needed, and your
  joints can be neutrally positioned. To me, reclined and supine seem
  much healthier than typical sitting. The main problem with extended
  use of these postures is that it's easy to get too relaxed, and get
  tired / lazy.

* **Standing / leaning / walking / dancing:** These postures are all
  active, energetic, upright. They are great for incorporating some
  more muscle activation and movement into your day. They also nicely
  balance out the other group of more relaxing postures, by being more
  energetic.

I intentionally omitted **sitting** from the above groups, but
certainly that's a viable option too. In terms of activeness it's
somewhere between the above groups. To me the big issue with sitting
is how easy and common it is to have compromised posture, particularly
the classic slouching forward head posture, causing all kinds of
spinal pain and related trouble. If it isn't mixed with more active
postures, then there is also the issue with sitting being relatively
sedentary.

There are lots of studies about the harmful effects of extended,
chronic sitting. There are many studies about the dangers of being
sedentary, including supine - laying down all day is not very
healthy. There are even some studies about prolonged standing
still. None of these postures are perfect, but I assert their
negatives can be greatly mitigated by switching between them, so that
none are done for extended periods.

I am not aware of any studies showing adverse effects of lots of
walking or dancing :)

[^ergo-hobbyist]:
    I am a hobbyist in ergonomics, I have no credentials related to
    ergonomics, nor have I studied much of the academic literature on
    the topic. Mostly, I've just followed my own intuition, sought
    what feels good, and avoided what causes pain. So please take my
    advice with a grain of salt, and perhaps experiment to see what
    works for you!
