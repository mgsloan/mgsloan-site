Today I was doing some standing computing (as described in the
[standing keyboard section of the deskless wfh
post][deskless-standing-keyboard]), when I realized I wanted to be
able to take quick inversion breaks (handstands, headstands).  Doing
these inversions is impeded because I needed to detach my keyboard.
Two solutions occurred to me:

1. Use straps + buckle to allow for quick attachment / detachment.

2. Also suspend the keyboard, so I can just walk up to it and start
   using it. Since the materials for this were readily at hand, I gave
   this option a shot!  It took less than 5 minutes to set this up,
   which is a pretty great turnaround from idea to implementation.

Here's the initial implementation, using the same [adjustable
tie-downs][] and [adhesive hangers][] described in the ["Laptop
Ceiling Suspension" post][]:

Here are some closeups on how it's attached:

The same can be done suspending it from branches / even twigs, just
using the [adjustable tie-downs][]:

Roughly what it looks like in use:

So far I'm liking this a lot!  I think there are still some advantages
over a stationary mount, because the keyboard still has some movement
freedom - I can move side to side / turn a bit.  This movement freedom
is not quite as much as suspension from pants, but there is the
notable benefit that I can immediately walk away from the computer
without having a keyboard attached to me!
