A few months ago, I pulled a muscle in my lower back, by rock climbing
after doing lots of back-bends and handstand practice. I quickly went
from feeling fairly nimble to hobbling around with limited mobility
and an inability to sit at a desk. Argh!

Happily, I was prepared with some very comfortable and
ergonomic[^ergo-hobbyist] ways to use the computer while laying down
([supine][]). After about a week of doing this and phasing in some
exercise, I could finally stand up straight again!

This post describes variations on supine computing - what's worked
best for me so far.

## Hammock Computing!

The best variety of supine computing is in a hammock! Here is a photo
from summer of 2018:

![Using a computer ergonomically in a hammock, via external split
keyboard and computer suspended above head
](./images/back-yard-hammock.jpg)

This is highly ergonomic - most joints are in quite neutral positions.
In particular, your neck can be fully relaxed because the screen is
above your head.

In the photo above, the laptop is suspended via [releasable zip
ties][] threaded through a nice strap that came with some gymnastic
rings.  Ratchet straps are even better for this purpose, as they have
a builtin way to tension them. In the photo below, a ratchet strap is
tensioned from one end of the hammock stand to the other:

[releasable zip ties]: https://smile.amazon.com/Releasable-cable-inch-50LBS-100pcs/dp/B00ANAWGM2

In this case, zip ties are attaching to little wire loops wrapped
around the laptop's hinges. Loops like this, or carabiners, are not
necessary but they are a bit more convenient. With most ThinkPad
laptops, and likely many other brands, its possible to thread the zip
ties through between the body and screen or at the hinges. Here's a
more recent picture showing this:

![zip tie threaded through x1 carbon
](./images/zip-tied-x1-carbon.jpg)

I find that ThinkPads are more than sturdy enough to be suspended by
their hinges. Sometimes I'll have the full weight on one hinge, while
attaching the other. Please use your best judgment about what your
laptop can handle[^screen-damage].

[^screen-damage]:
    A couple years ago, I got in the habit of leaving zip ties
    threaded through the hinges of my laptop for convenience. This
    worked quite well, and I still sometimes do it. There is a
    potential danger to this, though - one evening I hastily closed my
    laptop onto a twisted zip tie, and that broke the screen. Argh!
    Thankfully, ThinkPads are relatively easy to repair, so I just put
    in a another screen.

## Not just for hammocks

This is probably obvious, but supine computing is not just for
hammocks! It's great for computing anywhere you can lay down. Since I
also want to encourage computing outdoors and hammocking, all of the
photos below will involve a ["flying saucer" hammock][].

## Laziest approach: pillows (but poor ergonomics)

This approach can be quite convenient for short sessions:

![using pillow head support in circular hammock
](./images/supine-pillowing.jpg)

Using a [Kinesis Advantage 2][] keyboard works quite well in this
posture, since there is a good amount of space between your
hands. This might not be viable with other types of keyboards, but
certainly worth a try.

The neck ergonomics are not ideal, though - doing extended sessions
like this can cause neck soreness. So, please try to avoid that!

## Much better: screen above head + split keyboard

Ideally, the screen would be above your head. Here, it's suspended via
the same zip tie approach as above:

![screen above head + split keyboard supine computing
](./images/ergo-supine.jpg)

Another improvement in this picture is using a split keyboard. In this case it's
a [keyboard.io][], but other split keyboards like the [ErgoDox][] can work great
too. By placing the keyboard halves to either side, your arms can be in a more
relaxed position.

This is much better than the prior supine posture. It doesn't seem to
put much strain anywhere, and so is quite viable for extended
computing sessions. It's also quite simple - split keyboard to either
side, and screen above your head.

## Other suspension methods

There are a huge variety of other ways to suspend a horizontal display
above you. Pretty much any well anchored rope or strap will support
the zip-ties-around-hinges approach. Here are a few more suspension
ideas:

* Simply screw hooks into a strut in the ceiling.

* [Suction cups][] worked surprisingly well when I tried them, but
  only on smooth ceilings.

* [3M Command Hooks][] work well on walls and slanted ceilings, but
  not well on flat ceilings, as they are not very strong perpendicular
  to the surface. It might be sufficient for lightweight laptops /
  tablets.

* There are also a [variety of laptop stands][] intended for bed use. The only
  one I've personally used is the [MagicHold Laptop stand][], which I mostly use
  for [reclined computing][]. Like nearly all of these stands, their intended
  use does not involve the screen being entirely horizontal. For the MagicHold
  stand, the usual zip tie configuration can be used. I suspect for many of the
  stands, more direct attachment of the laptop could allow them to be used for
  fully horizontal supine computing.

## Other supine approaches

* I have a vague recollection from around ten years ago of [Timothy Hobbs][]
  sharing a photo of supine computing on some freenode IRC channel, with a
  [DataHand split keyboard][] and a screen suspended above his head via a
  cardboard box. I googled for "timthelion data hands" and came across [a post
  from 2008][] which ends with a more evolved version of his supine computing
  setup, which appears to be using a desk to support the monitor. It looks like
  more recently he's also had some interesting [adventures in outdoor wearable
  computing][].

* After deciding to call this post "Supine Computing", I googled that
  phrase and came across a post by Justin Craig-Kuhn, titled ["DIY
  Supine
  Workstation"](https://medium.com/@jcraigk/healthy-hacking-diy-supine-workstation-cbaadcbbc2aa).
  He kindly gave me permission to reuse his photo here:

  ![Justin Craig-Kuhn's supine setup
  ](./images/supine-jcg.jpg)

  Cool stuff!! A couple notes on this:

    * He's using an ipad as a screen along with a gooseneck tablet
    mount. This has nice adjustability, and is more elegant than putting
    a full laptop there. However, as he points out, using an IPad as a
    display adds some lag, about 20ms.

    * The keyboard position may well be better than mine, because each
    half is oriented vertically. This allows forearm rotation to be in
    the middle of its range rather than near its limit. I don't feel
    strain there, though, so I don't feel the need to do this.

* There are a variety of expensive solutions for reclined / supine
  computing workstations. For example, the offerings from [AltWork][]
  and [ErgoQuest][] are quite visually dramatic:

  ![Expensive reclining workstations from AltWork and ErgoQuest
  ](./images/stations.jpg)

  While I find these workstations quite cool, right now I can't
  justify the expense and non-portability. I prefer approaches which
  are inexpensive, portable, and use commonly found materials, such
  that they are more easily shared.

## Getting weird: upside down belay glasses

Alternatively, belay glasses can be used to allow your neck to be in a neutral
position:

![supine computing with belay glasses
](./images/belay-glasses.jpg)

Specifically, these are [clip on belay glasses][], which can be used while
belaying someone rock climbing, to allow you to watch the climber without
craning your neck. In this case, they are flipped upside down such that your
vision is downwards. This actually works fairly well, but certainly looks quite
strange.

I haven't found myself doing this much, likely due to the following
reasons:

* It can be a little finicky, though possible, to get the prisms
  oriented such that the screen is visible for both eyes. It's
  unpleasant for parts of the screen to be occluded for one eye.

* When used outside, glare from the sky above can be more of a
  problem.

* They induce some [chromatic aberration][], which can make text
  harder to read. This might be avoided by using a prism material with
  a lower refractive index.

## Downsides of supine computing

* Can be way too comfortable and relaxing, causing drowsiness. The best way to
  deal with this is to do a bit of exercise. A really good cycle is switching
  between a treadmill desk, standing, and supine computing.

* You may find yourself using your computer in bed more
  frequently. I've read in a number of reputable places that it's good
  sleep hygiene to only use your bed for sleep and sex. So, if
  possible, please try to make your supine computing habit somewhere
  other than where you sleep.

## Upsides of supine computing

* Can allow you to comfortably use the computer when an injury might
  otherwise prevent it.

* Is a great posture to include in a rotation of
  postures[^many-postures]. For example, I don't find it practical to
  stand or walk (on a treadmill desk) for the entire day. Mixing in
  some supine computing makes it entirely viable to avoid all sitting.

  [^many-postures]:
    I don't think there is one ideal ergonomic posture. It seems sensible to
    switch between a variety of decently ergonomic postures. This way, the
    particular stresses and strains of each posture are less likely to
    accumulate into disorder.

* It's a great way to do some physical resting while still getting
  things done. Sometimes it's better to take a proper nap, but other
  times I find that I'm physically tired but mentally active - this is
  a great posture for those times.

## Thanks for reading!

Thanks for reading this post, I hope some of you are inspired to try
out supine computing, perhaps even outside! If you're dealing with
back pain - argh - that sucks :( ! But I hope this approach helps you
manage some of that, or at least work around it.

If you do experiment with this stuff, I'd be curious to see what you
come up with! My email address is this site's hostname at gmail.com

Also, I'm working on more posts exploring other approaches, which I
hope to publish in the next few weeks. See also my prior posts on
[reclined computing][] and [airplane computing][].  If you're interested in this stuff, please
check back in a while, or perhaps subscribe to my [atom feed][].

[^ergo-hobbyist]:
    I am a hobbyist in ergonomics, I have no credentials related to
    ergonomics, nor have I studied much of the academic literature on
    the topic. Mostly, I've just followed my own intuition, sought
    what feels good, and avoided what causes pain. So please take my
    advice with a grain of salt, and perhaps experiment to see what
    works for you!
