I built some polarizer glasses!

This was directly inspired by a comment from [u/elonfutz][] in [a
reddit thread][digital nomad deskless ergo] for one of my blog posts:

Brilliant!  I love the idea of reducing glare while keeping the screen
appearing the same.  Though I think there are [plenty of viable ways
to use your computer on sunny days][working with sun], polarized
glasses like these help too.

You might wonder why I would go through the trouble of building
glasses.  After all, polarized sunglasses exist, you'd think something
like that might be sufficient.  See the ["Other options considered"
section][] for more info on that topic.

## The build

Materials:

* Two [Bower 58mm Polarizers][].

* Two [AmazonBasics UV Protection Camera Filters][].

* I used [18 gauge half hard sterling silver][] wire that I originally
  got for making [more permanent laptop hinge attachments][wire around
  hinges].

* One packet of black [Sugru moldable glue][].

* Tools: Needle nose pliers + soldering iron (and solder)

I chose 58mm because that size seemed to roughly match the largest
diameter of my eyeglasses.  I also have an old DSLR with this size
lens, so if I want a polarizer for it I'll have one.

My first step was to trace my eyeglasses and used this to inform the
position of the lenses:

I then traced the desired lens position and chose a bridge position
similar to my eyeglasses, and used the needle nose pliers + hand force
to bend the wire into this shape:

![wire formed to initial shape for glasses

I then sloppily soldered along the overlapping wire, with the wire
pressed into the groove of the lens threading.  This actually turned
out to be sufficient to keep the lenses in place, even though the
solder made no contact with the plastic.

Retrospectively, it made no sense for the wire overlap to be right at
the nose section. The addition of Sugru later made up for this, but if
I were to do this again, I wouldn't have made that choice.

I decided to skip having hinges for the temples, since that would
greatly complicate things. So, I just bent some wire at a 90 degree
angle (with an arc on the short bit to match the circle), and soldered
it:

By putting the glasses on, I then estimated a length for the temple
and snipped it:

After doing the same on the other sides, and making the curved temple
tips, these are really starting to look like glasses!

I then tried wearing them in practice, and predictably, the soldered
nose area and bare wire temple tips started getting bothersome. Sugru
to the rescue!

I used one packet of Sugru, and added it to the nose region and temple
tips, resulting in the image at the beginning of this post.  This
stuff is great, it is very easy to mold and it has a rubbery feel
after it cures.  I'll be curious to see how it holds up to
wear-and-tear - I'm optimistic that it will be fine.

## Results

I built these less than a week ago, and there were a couple overcast
days.  So far I've only used them for a few hours, and I'm liking them
a lot so far!

They are indeed effective at reducing glare.  I can comfortably use
the computer monitor while facing roughly in the direction of the sun.
A potential downside of this is that this also makes it a bit easier
to get sunburnt as it makes shade less necessary.  Don't ask how I
found that out...!

## Other options considered

After discussing the polarized computer glasses idea with
[u/elonfutz][], I began strongly desiring glasses that were purely
polarizing in the proper angle for my screens.

By experimenting with my vertically polarized sunglasses, I determined
that my ThinkPad laptop screens, an X1 and a P51, are both vertically
polarized.  This is great because that's the same direction as
polarized sunglasses.  So, in a pinch the sunglasses can work decently
for laptop use.  However, since they also generally dim, some of the
screen's brightness is also lost.

I looked around for something like sunglasses, but just polarization
and no tint.  The closest I could find was [driving glasses like
these](https://smile.amazon.com/Fitover-Driving-Glasses-Charcoal-Yellow/dp/B07B4S9P58/).
These turned out to not be very heavily polarized, and so did not cut
down on glare very much.

Along the way, I also realized that my computer monitor is
horizontally polarized - the opposite of sunglasses.  I couldn't find
readily available glasses with horizontal polarization, but I did come
across the following:

* [IRL Glasses - Glasses that Block Screens — Kickstarter][] which are
  horizontally polarized in order to block screens.  This suggests to
  me that vertical polarization is more popular than horizontal.

* Via a [coincidental reddit post][], I found out about sunglasses
  with tint that is mechanically adjusted by a knob.  Each lens has
  two polarizers, and the knob rotates one of the pairs of
  polarizers.  I put in an order for the [closest product I could find
  to this](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ASAPOC/), though it
  might take a while to receive as they are out of stock. My hope is
  that I can remove the non-rotating polarizers and modify these to be
  horizontally polarized.

Since nothing was readily available, I did a bit of brainstorming on
how to make glasses with variable-angle polarization.  This resulted
in the design above, based on camera lenses.  It seemed like it would
be straightforward to build, functional, and weird looking.  So, I
pretty much had to give it a shot!
