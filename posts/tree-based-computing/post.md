This post is about one of the most portable and
ergonomic[^ergo-hobbyist] ways I've found to use the computer
outside. It's highly flexible - works anywhere you can find a tree!
This particular tree already had a rope around it for hanging a
hammock:

This might look quite odd at first - very understandable! If that
impression is prohibiting you from giving it a try, perhaps consider
trying out [deck desking][] or [hammock computing][] to warm up to the
idea of outdoor computing. For indoor uses of suspension, see the
[deskless work-from-home setups][] post.

## Inspiration

Back in the fall of 2017, I was feeling confined by my passion and
profession of software engineering. I do not regret this focus one
bit, it's a very generative and rewarding thing to focus on! However,
it seemed to require me to stay inside all the time. I got tired of
this, yearning to spend more time surrounded by nature and breathing
fresh air. I started questioning the assumption that I needed to stay
inside all the time, and started brainstorming solutions.

Specifically, I sought a way to work outside nearly anywhere, such
that I could optimize for:

* Awesome views!

* Not having many people around / walking by (less distraction and
  feels less obtrusive).

* Avoiding sitting. I get quite enough sitting while indoors.

* Portability - being able to hike or bike out to a spot.

* Simplicity - I wanted it to be an approach easily shared with others
  (like in this post!).

To satisfy these goals, I required a substitute for a standing
desk. So I started considering what common things in nature can act as
a furniture substitute. Suddenly it dawned on me: **Trees!!**

By using trees to support the screen, it's quite feasible to work
outside ergonomically with very little equipment. Here's a photo while
writing this post:

## How to attach laptops to trees

I'm a long-time user of ThinkPad laptops, and so I have only tried to
attach those to trees. I have some ideas[^other-laptops] for doing
this with other laptops, but haven't tried it yet.

Many, if not all ThinkPads allow the screen to be open 180°, such that
it is flat with the plane of the keyboard. For example, here is a
closer picture of an [X1 Carbon][] ThinkPad open flat against a
tree:

![ThinkPad X1 Carbon flat on tree
](./images/x1-carbon-flat.jpg)

The laptop is supported by [releasable zip ties][] which are threaded
between the screen and chassis near the hinges, and then around the
rope. Not much tension is needed on the rope, friction is enough to
hold everything up. A ratchet strap works quite well too, but a simple
rope can be less fuss. Just throw it around the tree, perhaps over a
branch or two on the other side, and tie a simple knot.

Many other things than zip ties could work, like string or wire.
Releasable zip ties are quite apt for this purpose, though, because
they are adjustable, strong, and rigid for threading.

![X1 carbon, zip ties going around the rope
](./images/x1-zip-ties-around-rope.jpg)

![P51, zip ties going around the rope
](./images/p51-zip-ties-around-rope.jpg)

The latter picture is of my [P51][], which is a much heavier laptop
than the X1. I've found it convenient to put little zip ties around
the hinges, to attach tiny carabiners[^dutchware]. This way, I can
clip right onto the zip ties, rather than fussing with supporting the
weight of the laptop while threading the zip tie.

[^other-laptops]:
    Laptops that do not open to 180 degrees could potentially be
    adapted by use of a wedge between the laptop body and
    tree. Alternatively something like the [standing tree desk
    platform][] could be used.

    Another thing that might be helpful would be some form of
    harness which wraps around the laptop body and provides attachment
    points. This would be helpful for laptops that do not have a
    sufficient gap between screen and body for threading zip ties.

[^dutchware]:
    Specifically these are [DutchWare titanium ridgeline biners][], but
    such fanciness is unnecessary, I just think they are cool.

## How to attach keyboards to pants

These days, my preferred standing keyboard setup is also the simplest
I've found. It just requires two things: a [Kinesis Advantage
keyboard][Kinesis Advantage] and a heavy duty [28" long zip
tie][]. The large zip tie is simply threaded through a belt or pants
drawstring, and around the keyboard:

![attaching keyboard step 1
](./images/attach-keyboard-1.jpg)
![attaching keyboard step 2
](./images/attach-keyboard-2.jpg)
![attaching keyboard step 3
](./images/attach-keyboard-3.jpg)

This takes just a few seconds to setup, allows a lot of mobility, and
keeps the keyboard in the right spot / orientation.

See the ["Deskless standing keyboard" section][] of the ["Deskless
Ergonomic Work-From-Home Setups" post][] for a bit more info. There
will hopefully be a more detailed post about this in the future.

## Postural variety: leaning / sitting

I don't find it practical to stand for more than a couple hours. One
thing that helps a lot is to move around a bit or stretch. I often
find myself listening to tunes and moving to the music.

Even with some movement, for extended sessions it can be very helpful
to be able to lean or sit, perhaps on another tree, stump, or
rock. Part of the fun of tree based computing is choosing your tree. I
did a fair bit of the work on this post at this tree, near a very nice
rock formation for leaning and sitting:

![computer on tree next to rock seat 1
](./images/rock-seat-1.jpg)

![computer on tree next to rock seat 2
](./images/rock-seat-2.jpg)

Since picking your tree based on this criteria is not always practical
or comfortable, it can be nice to bring along a leaning stool. I've
tried two relatively portable leaning stools:

* The [Focal Mogo Stool][] is very comfortable. It also packs somewhat
  portably, by collapsing the leg and attaching it to the back of the
  seat. It can fit just fine in a larger backpack. I often use it at a
  treadmill desk, to take a break from walking.

* The [Sitpack Zen][] is far more portable, about the size of a medium
  size water bottle and just 1lb, but not quite as comfortable. I only
  just used it for the first time a few days before publishing this
  post, and I really like it! I will probably always pack it instead
  when hiking or biking. Here are a couple photos:

## Handling the sun

The sun can be troublesome for computer use outside, but it's not as
prohibitive as might be intuitively expected. Some general solutions
and principles related to this are discussed in the ["Working with
Sun" section][] of the [deck desk post][deck desking]. I have one main
tip particularly for tree based outdoor computing, demonstrated by the
photos below:

![standing in and out of tree shadow
](./images/tree-shadow-sun-face.jpg)

On the left, I'm standing in the shadow of the tree trunk, and so can
comfortably read the screen.  On the right, I'm standing outside the
shadow, so the sun would shine in my eyes, making the screen
unviewable.  By positioning the screen opposite the sun and standing
in the tree's shadow, there's no direct sunlight on the screen, and
none in my eyes either!

Wearing a hat which provides shade is also worth considering.

## Update: adjustable paracord tie-downs

I wrote most of this post a few months ago, in the fall. Since then, I
acquired some [adjustable paracord tie-downs][], and have started
preferring using one or two of these to suspend my laptop. The
viability of this approach is probably related to Colorado trees
having low branches. Here are some photos of this approach:

![two photos of adjustable paracord tie-down being used to support laptop
](./images/paracord.jpg)

I like these because the length between the hooks is easily adjusted -
just hold down a button and slide the cord.

## Prior art: "Standing Tree Desk" on instructables

After realizing that trees were a great source of support, I did some
googling around for using them for computer use. I only found one
example, a set of instructions for a beautiful [laser-cut desk][] that
can be strapped to the tree. Here are some photos from that page:

[laser-cut desk]: https://www.instructables.com/id/Standing-Tree-Desk/

![standing tree desk
](./images/standing-tree-desk.jpg)

Pretty darn cool if you ask me! I think those instructions are what
inspired me to use ratchet straps when first experimenting with tree
based computing.

However, the ergonomics don't look great, due to the typical problems
with laptop ergonomics.  Since the screen is adjacent to the keyboard,
you've either got to put your neck / back in a poor position, or put
the screen in the right spot but have your arms in an uncomfortable
posture.

The instructions for building this desk ended with:

> The biggest problem with this design is lack of portability. I
> originally wanted to laser cut a laptop stand with the idea that it
> would be a quick assembly/reassembly in the field, and otherwise it
> would flat-pack. After I press-fit this guy together though, it is
> not coming apart without breaking. But I have new designs in the
> works! I was thinking going simpler. Two planks and a hinge. What
> ideas do all you have?

I really appreciated that this problem was noted, along with the call
to action. I did indeed start considering how to make this more
portable. Turns out it's feasible to use tree support without a
platform at all, as shown earlier!

## Go try it!

I thoroughly enjoy my tree based computing sessions - it's a rather
nice way to use your computer while also immersing yourself in
nature[^nature-immersion]. If this seems interesting to you, I
encourage you to go try it! I also encourage you to experiment - if
the ideas here don't directly work for you, perhaps you can find a
variation that does.

I do have one ask before you set off on such adventures, which is to
please be considerate of other people. Typing away at a busy scenic
overlook doesn't seem so cool for those that are out there to enjoy
peace and quiet away from technology. For this reason, along with
considerations of my own focus, I much prefer spots that are tucked
away.

Happy trees (based computing)!

[^nature-immersion]:
    I can imagine that some nature lovers might be horrified by this
    idea. They might treasure the unplugged nature of a hike,
    rightfully so! For me, the idea here is that this way I can spend
    much more time in nature than I otherwise could (while still
    fulfilling my interests and obligations). This complements my more
    peaceful and present times in nature, rather than replacing them.

[^ergo-hobbyist]:
    I am a hobbyist in ergonomics, I have no credentials related to
    ergonomics, nor have I studied much of the academic literature on
    the topic. Mostly, I've just followed my own intuition, sought
    what feels good, and avoided what causes pain. So please take my
    advice with a grain of salt, and perhaps experiment to see what
    works for you!
