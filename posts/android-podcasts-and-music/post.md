synopsis: A couple tips for listening to podcasts and music simultaneously.

## Context

Podcasts and audiobooks are a great way to get info. I particularly
like them because I can simultaneously do things that don't require
singular focus, such as driving, exercising, doing dishes, cooking,
etc.

I also like listening to music during those activities, and in the
past I was faced with a choice between the two. Why not both!?

On a computer, it's easy to listen to both simultaneously - just start
both, and adjust volume levels. Typically I'm listening on an Android
phone, though, which has some limitations:

* Typically there's just one app with the current "audio focus".

* There is no per-app volume control, only a master volume control.

How can we work around these limitations? The next section explains
one possibility.

## How-to

I listen to podcasts on [Podcast Addict][] and music on [Spotify][]. I
haven't tried many other apps, but these are popular and work decently
enough. Anyway, with those particular apps, here's how to listen to
both:

* Make it so that [Podcast Addict][] ignores audio focus requests. In
  particular:

  1. Press the vertical ellipsis in the top right corner.

  2. Press "App settings", then "Player".

  3. Scroll all the way to the bottom of the Player settings.

  4. Check the "Ignore Audio Focus requests" option, which is
  currently marked "Experimental".

* In [Spotify][]'s settings, enable the "Normalize volume" option and
  set the "Volume level" to "Quiet". This makes the podcasts much more
  intelligible, since they aren't competing as much with the music,
  amplitude-wise.

## Miscellania

* Some podcasts aren't very loud. It can also be helpful to enable
  Podcast Addict's "Volume boost" setting, which is within the "Audio
  Player" settings. This requires enabling "Audio effects".

* Enabling audio effects can also be used to set a different playback
  speed. For example, I have a default set to 1.5x speed, since I'm
  mostly listening to informational podcasts rather than podcasts
  where timing and pace is significant.

* One thing to note is that if you use headphones with a button that
  controls pause / play / next, then it will apply to the last app you
  hit the play button on.  I typically prefer to play the podcasts
  second, so that pause / play applies to it.

* This works fine with google maps also providing audio
  directions. Three audio streams, hah! Also, note that you can change
  the maps voice. I prefer the "English (UK)" voice over the "English
  (US)" voice:

  1. Press the 3 horizontal bars next on the left side of the search
     box, to open up the sidebar.

  2. Press "settings", then "navigation settings", then "Voice
     selection".

* Instead of a regular aux cable in the car, I use a TRRS cable from
  some headphones which has an inline button to control play /
  pause. Can be quite handy!
