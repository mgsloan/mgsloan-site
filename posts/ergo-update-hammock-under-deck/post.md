I found a rather nice spot under the deck for my [Dutchware Chameleon
backpacking hammock][]:

You might notice that there are some hooks hanging down.  These are
for suspending my laptop screen above my head, for ergonomic supine
computing! These hooks are [adjustable tie-downs][], attached via
[adhesive hangers][]. The nice thing about these adhesive hangers is
that they can be removed without damaging the surface.

So, this is very similar to the approach of suspending from zip-ties /
wire as described in the ["Laptop Ceiling Suspension"
post][]. However, this was relatively unstable because the front of
the body ended up resting on the ridgeline. I discovered that putting
the hooks through the zip ties and hooking to the ridgeline added some
nice stabilization:

I realize it might be hard to visualize how this works.  Perhaps I
will post some pictures of this hammock setup in use at some point.
For now, here's a picture from the ["Tree based Computing" post][]:
