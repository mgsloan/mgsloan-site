I quite like being able to place my laptop screen where I want it in
space. In my ["Supine Computing" post][], zip ties are used to attach
a laptop to a strap above a regular hammock, and to the support straps
of a circular hammock. This post goes into a related idea, an easy and
convenient way to suspend laptops indoors.

## Sitting with suspended laptop

If I'm feeling like using my computer on my futon, I just clip it to
some [adjustable tie-downs][tie-downs] hanging from the ceiling:

Another approach is to use a laptop stand, such as the [Magichold
stand][] shown in the [Deck Desk post][deck-desk]. While this stand is
fairly portable, I prefer to leave it setup with my recliner.

## Supine with suspended laptop

If I'm feeling like going supine, I can just move one of the tie-downs
to another hook which rotates things 90 degrees:

To allow a quick transition between these two postures, the adhesive
hooks on the ceiling are in this configuration:

One thing to note is that the spacing here is less narrow than
ideal. I later realized that spacing wider than the width of the
laptop leads to more rotational stabilization.

## Materials: adhesive hangers + adjustable paracord

I'm currently renting, and would prefer to avoid maintenance on move
out, so I began looking for suspension approaches which avoid putting
holes in the ceiling. The ceiling is textured, so suction cups
wouldn't work. So, I began looking for adhesive hooks available
online, but most seemed to be intended for the wall, and had
relatively low weight ratings. This makes sense, as adhesives
typically have higher shear strength.

After comparing options for a while I ordered ["Multi Purpose No
Drilling Required Ceiling Hooks Suspension and Wall Hooks
Hangers"][adhesive hangers] from the cryptic brand "CRH600" - 12
adhesive hooks for $15. They're intended for the ceiling, and the
comments indicate a max load of around 6 or 7 pounds. Perfect! Even my
heaviest laptop, a P51 ThinkPad workstation, weighs less than the
limit, 5.8 pounds.

I also wanted to be able to easily configure the height of my laptop,
and so looked around at various adjustable ropes and
cords[^other-cord-order]. I eventually ordered a couple packs of
[Progrip "Better Than Bungee" paracord tie-downs][tie-downs]. These
tie-downs are awesome, I've since ordered more packs since I keep
finding more uses for them. Both ends have carabiner-like hooks, and
one end adjusts position on the cord by holding down a lever. They are
also strong - I've used a single one of these to suspend around 30lbs,
and it handled it just fine for days on end (not from adhesive
hangers).

Here's what the [adhesive hangers][] and [tie-downs][] look like:

    I also tried [Nite Ize's "Rope Tightener with Rope,
    1-3/4in."](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BKVPY0O), which
    uses a "CamJam" to secure the paracord. I found that these were
    more awkward to adjust than Progrip's "Better Than Bungee"
    tie-downs.

## Zip ties around hinges

A rather nice way to add attachment loops to a laptop is threaded
between the screen and body, around the hinges, like this:

## Alternative to zip ties: wire around hinges

I have also had success with wire around my laptop hinges. The benefit
of this is that they don't need to be taken on and off the way
[releasable zip ties][] tend to. This idea is still being refined, but
here are a few images that should give some idea of what I'm talking
about:

* Wire sloppily placed around the hinge. I used this for about a
  month - it worked great.

  ![wire sloppily put around ThinkPad hinge
  ](./images/rough-wire-around-hinge.jpg)

* Wire more neatly placed around the axle of the hinge. I'm waiting
  for a soldering iron to arrive in the mail to finish it. I sold my
  old soldering iron when I last pared down my possessions, foolishly
  thinking I could always use a makerspace.

  ![more tidy wire around ThinkPad hinge

* The wire and tools I'm using to bend it. I have no idea what I'm
  doing - there's a whole art of wire bending - and I'm just winging
  it. For fun I did get some premium wire, though, [18 gauge half hard
  sterling silver][]. I figured since I need so little wire, may as
  well get pretty and sturdy stuff.

## Other suspension points: window blinds / curtain track

ThinkPads and other laptops that open all the way to flat can also be
suspended in front of a window for indoor standing setups.  Often
windows have blinds or curtains which can be conveniently reused for
the suspension.

* Below, [adjustable tie-downs][tie-downs] are wrapped directly around
  blinds, and hooked to themselves:

  ![window curtain suspension
  ](./images/window-curtain-suspension.jpg)

* Below, two [reusable "Mille-Ties"][] are threaded between a curtain
  track and the ceiling, around the plate attaching it to the
  ceiling. This allows the curtain to still close without removing the
  ties!

  These ties are pretty cool, they are a bit stretchier than
  releasable zip ties, but these are thinner and more bendable, so
  they have their uses. They can also be used instead of releasable
  zip ties for adding attachment loops to laptops.

You might wonder how I'm typing when standing at a window. For these
setups, I typically have my keyboard suspended from my pants, like in
the ["Deskless Ergonomic Work-From-Home Setups" post][].

## Other use: rowing machine entertainment

This is also a nice way to put a screen at head height while using a
rowing machine:
