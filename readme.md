[![Build Status][ci-img]][ci]

This is the source code for [my personal site](mgsloan). It is based directly on
[the code](ruudva-repo) for [Ruud van Asseldonk's site](ruudva). The site uses a
custom static site generator written in Haskell.

Here's a description of the generator written by Ruud van Asseldonk, from his
[readme.md]:

> The generator includes a tiny templating engine, an html and css minifier, and
> an aggressive font subsetter. One of my objectives was to cut all the crap
> (which almost by definition includes javascript) without compromising on
> design. An average page of my site weighs less than jQuery alone (which
> jokingly describes itself as “lightweight footprint”). That includes webfonts.

I have disabled the clever webfont subsetting support, because instead I am
using some popular fonts served by google. My reasoning is that for many users
these will be cached.

# Installing dependencies

## stack

`stack` is a tool for building Haskell code. For many unix-ey systems, the
following will do:

```
$ curl -sSL https://get.haskellstack.org/ | sh
```

Otherwise see [the installation docs](stack-install). Once this is done, run
stack setup within this directory to install ghc:

```
$ stack setup
```

[stack-install]: https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/#how-to-install

## Compression tools

By default these aren't needed - only needed if relevant code in `Main.hs` is
uncommented.

```
$ sudo apt install zopfli brotli
```

# How to do quick iterative writing / modification

I like to be able to modify the Haskell, templates, and markdown, and quickly
see the results. In other words, I want to be able to just save files, and have
the browser automatically update. My current approach is a bit of a mishmash of
tools. I'd like something better, but it works well enough. Here's how I'm
currently doing this:

## Install ghcid and livereload

[ghcid] automates reloading code in `ghci`, Haskell's interpreter. Code gets
reloaded whenever source files change.

[livereload] is an node server that can be used with the [livereload chrome
plugin] to cause the browser to reload after changes.

```
$ stack install ghcid
$ npm install -g livereload
```

## Run ghcid

Then, in one terminal run the following:

```
$ ./interpret.sh
```

This script runs `ghcid`, configuring it to run `main` and watch the `posts` and
`templates` directory.

## Run python3 http server

Then in another terminal, run the following:

```
$ cd out
$ python3 -m http.server
```

This runs a web server that serves the output of site generation.

## Run livereload

Then, in yet another terminal, run the following:

```
$ cd out
$ livereload
```
