          <li>Please write a single html file which implements a simple particle system and spring system, and uses this to simulate a 10x10 clothlike grid</li>
          <li>Nice! Please make the nodes draggable.</li>
          <li>Cool!  Please add inter-node collisions and boxes that fly around randomly</li>

          <li>Nice! Can you make the tails all different random colors of the rainbow.  The bomb should kill the fish and turn them into bait</li>
          <li>Wow!  How about random reef structures as obstacles?</li>

          <li>Please write an interactive game for doing math with trees.  These trees should consist just of the operations +, *, =.  To indicate inversion (for subtraction and division), a slash annotates the edge in the tree diagram.  Nodes under the equality root should be draggable across, changing their slash annotation</li>
          <li>Pretty good!  I can drag the nodes, but I can't actually do algebraic manipulations (nothing happens when I drag to the other side of the equals)</li>
          <li>
            <p>Seems a bit closer, but a few bugs remain:</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>* The nodes jump / are offset quite a bit from the cursor position</p>
            <p>* The algebraic operations don't quite work.  For example, if I drag a "5" node under a "*" node, then a "*" node should get added to the other side of the "=" if one is not already at the top.  The "5" node then gets added with an edge that is red or crossed to indicate inversion.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>I'd also like a few more features:</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>* Also, "*" and "+" nodes should be able to have more than 2 children</p>
            <p>* Ability to add nodes to the tree</p>
            </li>
          <li>Please add the feature to change the numbers or variables like text editor</li>
        </ul>

          <li>Please write in a single html file a piano that you can click on to play</li>
          <li>Please extend to more octaves and add a drum pad</li>
          <li>Please make the keys light up when I use the keyboard to play them.  Also the drum sounds didn't work</li>

          <li>Please write a game where your character does dynamic moves from rock climbing hold to rock climbing hold.  Browser based single html file</li>
          <li>Make more holds and make it stick to the holds for half a second</li>
          <li>A little closer!  Also you should be able to jump and maintain momentum, so not actually stuck to the holds.  Also the holds should stay available rather than being disabled</li>
          <li>The holds should be similar to the ability to jump again, but only when the hold is near the character</li>
          <li>Nice, getting closer! Now make it jump like 3 times higher</li>
          <li>Only count a hold as reached the first time it's reached and turn it green.  Also if you reach the upper half of the screen start scrolling upwards and have more holds, indefinitely.  Make it so you lose a life every time you fall to the ground.  Start with 3 lives</li>

          <li>stick figure physics simulation.  Hands are attracted to feet of other stick figures</li>
          <li>Can you put this in a single html file I can load in the browser?</li>
          <li>Nice! Can the stick figure's body segments be like springs?  Also no gravity, like in space.  The attraction is also movign really slow, make it faster</li>
